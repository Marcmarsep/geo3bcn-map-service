# Python Flask Server for Volcanic Maps Visualization

This repository contains the source code for the Python Flask server responsible for serving the volcanic map viewer of the Geo3bcn - CSIC institute and the data visualization portal for EPOS.

## Installation

To install the Python dependencies, go to the directory where the source files are located and execute, either under python base or a virtual environment:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To configure the server, fill in the fields of your choice in the `config.ini` file. Remember that one of the requests from EPOS was to serve under the HTTPS port (443).

You can also configure the logging options in the `logging.conf` file.

## Execution

To run the server, execute:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

## Documentation

Once the service is started, you can access the autogenerated documentation and test the different endpoints through the URL `{host}:{port}/api`, for example: `map-service.geo3bcn.csic.es:5000/api`.
